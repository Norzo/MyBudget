# MyBudget

This project revolves around creating a budget calculator with Java.
The purpose of the budget calculator is to easily be able to put in your monthly salary, subtract monthly fees like rent, power bill and others in order to show the user how big of a budget they have to spend on other expenses such as food, clothing, recreational, etc.

The idea was brought to life simply because I wanted a way to manage my money in a more orderly fashion, as well as see how much I would have left over and plan my month more accordingly to the budget which stands during the month and at the end of it.
